<h1>Ansible Cluster Prometheus Grafana Arm7</h1>

Grafana and Prometheus setup on arm7 cluster (Raspberry Pi 4) with Ansible.

With minor changes this is basically a clone of @dinofizz repository https://github.com/dinofizz/picluster-ansible and his fine tutorial, at his website https://www.dinofizzotti.com/blog/2020-04-10-raspberry-pi-cluster-part-1-provisioning-with-ansible-and-temperature-monitoring-using-prometheus-and-grafana/

I have left some of his some roles out and made some minor changes here and there. If you run into trouble I surgest taking a look at his site, where he also provides some links for other usefull resources.

Prometheus access: localhost:9090
Grafana access: localhost:3000 (dafault password and user is "admin")
